\title{
IPM casewise with RF by \pkg{ranger} for OOB samples
}
\description{
The IPM for a case in the training set is calculated by considering and averaging
over only the trees where the case belongs to the OOB set. The case is put
down each of the trees  where the case belongs to the OOB set. For each tree, the case goes from the root node to a leaf through a series of nodes. The variable split in these nodes is recorded. The percentage of times a variable is selected along the case's way from the root to the terminal node is calculated for each tree. Note that we do not count the percentage of times a split occurred on variable k in tree t, but only the variables that intervened in the prediction of the case. The IPM for this case is obtained by averaging those percentages over only the trees where the case belongs to the OOB set. 
The random forest is based on a fast implementation of CART-RF.

\usage{
ipmranger(marbolr, da, ntree)
}
\arguments{  \item{marbolr}{
Random forest obtained with \code{\link[ranger]{ranger}}. Responses can be of the same type supported by \code{\link[ranger]{ranger}}. Note that  not only numerical or nominal, but also  ordered responses,  censored response variables and multivariate responses can be considered with \code{ipmparty}.}
  \item{da}{
Data frame with the predictors only, not responses, of the training set used for computing \emph{marbolr}. Each row corresponds to an observation and each column corresponds to a predictor. Predictors can be numeric, nominal or an ordered factor.}
  \item{ntree}{
Number of trees in the random forest.}
}
\details{
All details are given in Epifanio (2017).
}
\value{
It returns IPM for cases in the training set. It is estimated when they are OOB observations. It is a matrix with as many rows as cases are in da, and as many columns as predictors are in da.
